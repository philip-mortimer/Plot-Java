# Quadratic Curve Program

This program plots the function:
 
    f(x)=ax^2+bx+c

The user can enter the a, b and c values, and the minimum and maximum x values.

The program's main source file is `src/quadratic_curve/QuadraticCurveApplication.java`. 

As well as the source files in the `src/quadratic_curve` folder the program also uses source 
files in the `../Shared/src` folder structure.
