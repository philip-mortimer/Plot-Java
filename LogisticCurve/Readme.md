# Logistic Curve Program

This program plots the function:
 
    f(x)=L/(1+exp(-k(x-x0)))

where:

- k is the steepness of the curve
- x0 is the mid-point of the curve
- L is the value approached by the function as x approaches infinity

The user can enter the above values, and the minimum and maximum x values.

The program's main source file is `src/logistic_curve/LogisticCurveApplication.java`. 

As well as the source files in the `src/logistic_curve` folder the program also uses source 
files in the `../Shared/src` folder structure.
