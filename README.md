# Java Example Plot Programs

This repository contains programs which plot functions, such as the quadratic function, on line charts. 
These programs use JavaFX so JavaFX needs to be installed on your computer (see https://openjfx.io/).
The programs were developed using NetBeans, but this repository only currently contains source files.

The programs are to be found in the following folders:

|Sub-folder 	    |Description                                                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|LogisticCurve    |Plots logistic function.                                                      |
|QuadraticCurve   |Plots quadratic function.                                                     |
|SineCurve        |Plots sine function.                                                          |
|Shared           |Contains shared code which may be used by more than one of the above programs.|
